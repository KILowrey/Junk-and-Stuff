# my-in-class-junk
## all my garbage from following along in class

I don't want to build a million repositorys for a million 5 to 20 minute activitys that I will most likly never look at again. But I also want to store them in case I do. I can't do them in the GitLab folder because whenever I Pull I'll lose my work so here's this dumb repository. please do not judge me based on anything in here (or better yet don't look in here at all)

---

some activities are not here because they were just stuff like messing around on google

The following are going to be in their own repositories on GitHub
* 02-05-GithubPagesPersonal = KILowrey.github.io
* 02-06-GithubPagesProject = Elephant-Fan-Page

the following are things I need to do:
* Re-do 01-03-MyFirstHTML
* Do 01-06-HTML_CSS_Layout
