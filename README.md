# my-in-class-junk
## in-class activities for my UCSD Extention Coding Bootcamp. Stored in one place for later reference (for myself).

This is a repository for all of the in-class activites in my coding bootcamp. This is a very messy repository just meant to keep all of my useless junk in one place.

the origin of all the assignments here can be found on [my class's GitLab](https://ucsd.bootcampcontent.com/UCSD-Coding-Bootcamp/ucsd-sd-fsf-pt-06-2020-u-c)

some activities are not here because they were just stuff like messing around on google

The following are going to their own repositories on GitHub:
* 02-05-GithubPagesPersonal = KILowrey.github.io
* All of the Homework Assignments
* All of the Projects
