## all my garbage from following along in class

I don't want to build a million repositorys for a million 5 to 20 minute activitys that I will most likly never look at again. But I also want to store them in case I do. I can't do them in the GitLab folder because whenever I Pull I'll lose my work so here's this dumb repository. please do not judge me based on anything in here (or better yet don't look in here at all)
