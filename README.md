# my-in-class-junk
## in-class activities for my UCSD Extention Coding Bootcamp. Stored in one place for later reference (for myself).

I don't want to build a million repositorys for a million 5 to 20 minute activitys that I will most likly never look at again. But I also want to store them in case I do. I can't do them in the GitLab folder because whenever I Pull I'll lose my work so here's this dumb repository. please do not judge me based on anything in here (or better yet don't look in here at all)

the origin of all the assignments here can be found on [my class's GitLab](https://ucsd.bootcampcontent.com/UCSD-Coding-Bootcamp/ucsd-sd-fsf-pt-06-2020-u-c)
